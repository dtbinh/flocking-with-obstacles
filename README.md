# flocking-with-obstacles
Two NetLogo models to simulate obstacle avoidance in a multi-agent system.

## Flocking With Drawable Obstacles and Target
In this simulation obstacles can be drawn before and during simulation. Boids will try to avoid them will moving towards a target. The flock is attracted by the target's potential field.

## Flocking with Tree Avoidance and Target.nlogo
Here the obstacles (trees) are generated in random positions each time we setup the simulation. Like the previous model the flock moves towards the target.
